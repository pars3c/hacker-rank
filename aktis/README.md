# Test challenge for Aktis

## Technologies used
Python, Libraries(numpy, re, os)



## Instructions for running-median exercise
 * Open the terminal in the root folder of the project
 * Start your virtualenv
 * Type this on your terminal in case you don't have the following libraries `pip install os numpy`
 * Run `python median.py`
 * A folder called `custom-running-median` will be generated a long with the custom outputs with end the number corresponding to the provided test outputs
 * Note: After output02.txt it will take a while to generate the others because input03 and input04 have 100.000 results each, it will take around 20 minutes total to generate all the custom output files


## Instructions for mouse-vs-mouse exercise
 * Open the terminal in the root folder of the project
 * Start your virtualenv
 * Type this on your terminal in case you don't have the following libraries `pip install os re `
 * Run `python mouse-vs-mouse.py`
 * A folder called `custom-mouse-vs-mouse` will be generated a long with the custom outputs, with the end number corresponding to the provided test outputs



## Thank you for this opportunity

Looking forward to hear back from you
